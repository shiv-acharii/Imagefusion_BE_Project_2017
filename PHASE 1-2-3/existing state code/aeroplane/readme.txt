Simple image fusion algorithms using discrete stationary wavelet transform
are presented. 
 
Presenter: VPS Naidu, MSDF Lab, NAL
 
The images to be fused are sara51.jpg and saras52.jpg.
 
The matlab codes for image fusion included in this folder are:
SWTimfuse1L_dem.m : It is demo programme and it uses one level of decomposition
SWTimfuse2L_dem.m : It is demo programme and it uses two levels of decomposition
